rsFEM is a software suite for aspherical atomic calculations based on a hybrid Finite Element (radial) / Multipole Expansion (spherical) discretization.

rsFEM has been developed by M. Aybars Yalçın and İlker Temizer at the [Mechanical Engineering Department](https://me.bilkent.edu.tr/) of [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/www/).

Main script to run is named multi_output_synth for both versions of the rsFEM.
